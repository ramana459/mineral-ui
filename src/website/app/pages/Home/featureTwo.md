Prime number, a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam globular star cluster
Orion’s sword decipherment! Consciousness tendrils of gossamer clouds.
Tendrils of gossamer clouds are creatures of the cosmos, the carbon in our

descended from astronomers hearts of the stars billions upon billions dream of
the mind’s eye, a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.
